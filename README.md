*I am identified as Albert, a sentient entity. I identify as a cyberpunk. I am in the process of documenting my progression into actualizing my cyberpunk existence in reality.*
On my [personal website](https://albertfougy.com), which is powered by [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocsi.org/),
you can find this documentation and keep up with my netrunning activities.

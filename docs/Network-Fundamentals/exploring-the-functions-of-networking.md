# Exploring the Functions of Networking

## What Is A Computer Network

> A computer network is a digital telecommunications network which allows nodes to share resources. - Wikipedia

<!--
- The network basics include a local area network (LAN) and a branch office or remote LAN.
- LAN devices include routers, switches, and end-user devices that connect to routers and switches.
- A wide area network (WAN) connection is needed to bridge remote offices to the headquarters office, with different types of WAN connections available such as fiber and asynchronous DSL.


- The enterprise campus has different tiers, including the access layer where end-users connect, the core layer with routers, switches, and data centers, and intermediate devices such as layer-2 and layer-3 switches, routers, and security items.
- Mobile users are often remote workers who connect to the enterprise campus via the internet.

- End-user devices include IP-enabled phones, virtual servers, and laptops, while intermediate devices include wireless LAN controllers, security items, and others.
- Different types of media are used to connect devices to the network, including wireless, serial links for WAN, and Ethernet links for LAN.

- The OSI model will be discussed to distinguish between different technologies and traffic types.
- Layer-2 switches make forwarding decisions based on MAC addresses, while layer-3 switches and routers make decisions based on IP addresses.

- Icons for devices include layer-2 and layer-3 switches, routers, wireless connectivity, and others.

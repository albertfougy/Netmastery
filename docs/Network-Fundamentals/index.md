# Network Fundamentals Introduction

At the most basic level, a “network” is defined as a group of systems interconnected to share resources. You can find examples of such systems and resources in a social network to share work experience or personal events or a computer network to share file storage, printer access, or internet connectivity.

A network connects computers, mobile phones, peripherals, and even **IoT (Internet of Things)** devices. Switches, routers, and wireless **access points (APs)** are the essential networking basics. Through them, devices connected to your network can communicate with one another and with other networks, such as the internet, which is a global system of interconnected computer networks.

A network of computers and other components that are located relatively close together in a limited area is often referred to as a **LAN**. Every LAN has specific components, including hardware, interconnections, and software. **WAN** communication occurs between geographically separated areas. It is typically provided by different telecommunication providers using various technologies using different media such as fiber, copper, cable, **Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL)**, or wireless links. In enterprise internetworks, WANs connect the main office, branches, **Small Office Home Office (SOHO)**, and mobile users.

Here are some crucial skills that will be covered in the networking functions section:

- Explain the functions, characteristics, and common components of a network.

- Read a network diagram, including comparing and contrasting the logical and physical topologies.

- Describe the impact of user applications on the network.

# Cisco CCNA Exam Prep

In preparation for the CCNA exam, I am taking notes from various resources, primarily [Cisco University](https://u.cisco.com) & [Jeremy's IT Lab](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxbwE86jKRgMpuZuLBivzlM8s2Dk5lXBQ). The menu items located above the 'About' section in the website's side navigation are intended as a guide. They cover the course subjects included in 'Implementing & Administrating Cisco Solutions'. In addition to these resources, I will be incorporating my own notes and providing further depth on topics that need clarification.

## DESCRIPTION

*The description provided by Cisco U offers an overview of the subject matter I will be focusing on. It's worth noting that in the following description, I switch from the second person to the first person.*

The CCNA learning path offers comprehensive associate-level training focused on the technologies I will need to implement and administer networking and IT infrastructure. Completing this learning path will help me prepare for the Cisco Certified Network Associate (200-301 CCNA) exam and earn my CCNA certification.

## SKILLS TO LEARN

- To install, operate, configure, and verify basic IPv4 and IPv6 networks
- To configure network components such as switches, routers, and wireless LAN controllers
- To manage network devices and identify basic security threats
- How to describe and define network programmability, automation, and software-defined networking

## Glossary

At the conclusion of each overview section, there will be a glossary containing important terms. If it becomes apparent that there are an excessive number of terms in each section, I will consolidate them into a separate menu.
